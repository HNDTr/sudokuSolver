### Brief Descriptions
---
This sudoku solver offers both a user interface (UI) and a non-UI version. It utilizes the AC-3 algorithm and backtracking technique for solving puzzles, alongside a custom solver featuring forward-checking. While the custom solver may not consistently outperform AC-3, it occasionally requires fewer recursive calls, albeit typically resulting in longer solving times, especially evident when applied to challenging boards. To enhance its performance, incorporating heuristic strategies such as Most Constrained Variable and Least Constraining Value techniques could be beneficial.
